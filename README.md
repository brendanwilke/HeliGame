# HeliGame

**Description**

This program is a 4-player endless competition to see who has the highest score. Boost your controlled square and dodge the obstacles and narrowing cave walls that obstruct your path.

**Necessary Installations**

Java IDE (preferrably Eclipse)

**Usage**

The white squares all automatically move to the right on their own. They are also all affected by gravity and you have to fight a constant downward force. Each player has a respective "boost" button that they must use. The boost buttons are:

* **Player 1:** Z
* **Player 2:** F
* **Player 3:** U
* **Player 4:** P

Once all 4 players crash, the game will automatically move on to the next round. Each match is a set of 3 rounds and the player with the highest combined score after 3 rounds wins the game. To restart, player 1 must hold their button, the "Z" key, to restart the game.
